# OSP Component Dashboard Configuration
#
# Component versions are resolved from openshift-pipelines/hack release configs
# (https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/hack/tree/main/config/downstream/releases)
# when available. Versions without a hack release file fall back to operator's
# components.yaml + extra_components below.

# Support status for each version
# Values: full, maintenance, security, unsupported, upcoming, development
support_status:
  "main": development
  "next": development
  "1.22": upcoming
  "1.21": full
  "1.20": full
  "1.19": maintenance
  "1.18": security
  "1.17": security
  "1.16": unsupported
  "1.15": unsupported

# Operator branch/tag for each OSP version
# Used as fallback when no hack release file exists for a version.
# Versions with a hack release file (e.g., 1.22, next) don't need entries here
# but "main" always uses this since it points all components to main branches.

# Components not tracked in operator's components.yaml
# Format: {component: {osp_version: ref}}
# Only needed for versions without a hack release file (fallback).
# Versions covered by hack (1.22, next, etc.) get their components from there.
